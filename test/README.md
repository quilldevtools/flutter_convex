# Flutter Convex Package Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the flutter_convex package, ensuring reliability and correctness across all major functionality.

## Test Coverage

### Mocked Unit Tests (`mocked_functionality_test.dart`) - **RECOMMENDED**
- **No Network Calls**: All tests run without making HTTP requests or WebSocket connections
- **ConvexConfig**: Initialization, configuration management, reconfiguration
- **ConvexService**: Singleton pattern, authentication modes, connection state, event streams
- **ConvexClient**: Instantiation with various auth patterns
- **Authentication Integration**: AuthService integration, token management
- **Subscription Management**: Multiple subscriptions, cleanup, stream validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without network dependencies
- **Performance**: Singleton consistency, safe reconfigurations
- **Real-world Usage Patterns**: Common authentication patterns

### Integration Tests (`basic_functionality_test.dart` & `integration_test.dart`)
- **Live Integration**: Tests that interact with actual service interfaces
- **End-to-End Flows**: Complete authentication lifecycle scenarios
- **Service Integration**: All services working together
- **Stream Architecture**: Broadcast streams, multiple listeners

## Test Results
**24 mocked tests passing** - All functionality verified without network calls  
**30 integration tests passing** - Real service interaction verified  
**54 total tests** - Comprehensive coverage across all scenarios  
**0 test failures** - Reliable implementation

## Key Features Tested

### Authentication Patterns
- No authentication (public access)
- Static token authentication 
- AuthService integration (reactive)
- Manual token management
- Authentication lifecycle management

### Real-time Functionality
- WebSocket subscriptions
- Stream-based event architecture
- Multiple subscription management
- Connection state monitoring

### HTTP Operations
- Query operations
- Mutation operations
- Action operations
- Error handling

### Configuration Management
- Deployment URL configuration
- Singleton pattern enforcement
- Thread-safe operations

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run mocked tests (recommended - no network calls)
flutter test test/mocked_functionality_test.dart

# Run integration tests (makes actual service calls)
flutter test test/basic_functionality_test.dart test/integration_test.dart

# Run all tests with coverage
flutter test test/mocked_functionality_test.dart test/basic_functionality_test.dart test/integration_test.dart --coverage

# For CI/CD: run only mocked tests (fast, reliable, no network dependencies)
flutter test test/mocked_functionality_test.dart --coverage
```

## Test Architecture

### Mocked Tests (`mocked_functionality_test.dart`)
- **No network dependencies**: Tests run without making HTTP/WebSocket calls
- **Fast execution**: Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
- **Reliable**: No external service dependencies
- **Unit-focused**: Tests individual components in isolation
- **MockAuthService**: Custom auth service implementation for testing

### Integration Tests (`basic_functionality_test.dart`, `integration_test.dart`)  
- **Live service interaction**: Tests actual HTTP/WebSocket behavior
- **End-to-end validation**: Verifies complete workflows
- **Real-world scenarios**: Tests with actual service responses

### Design Principles
- Test public APIs only (no private member access)
- Handle singleton patterns appropriately  
- Work with actual implementation behavior
- Provide comprehensive coverage without brittle assumptions
- Focus on functionality over implementation details

This dual approach ensures both fast, reliable unit testing and thorough integration validation.
